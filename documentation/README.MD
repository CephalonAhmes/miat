Welcome to the miat package documentation!

First, you should know that this library requires you to use the pyqt5Agg backend and thus might not work for Jupyter Notebook IDEs that only have inline figure viewers. Spyder is a good example of a supported IDE. Aside from that, there should be no issues.

I split the documentation by tools, so just go to the subfolder corresponding to the tool you'd like to know more about.
